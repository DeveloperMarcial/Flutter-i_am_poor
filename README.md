# Flutter
Flutter Projects

Uploading a Flutter Project

1) .dart_tool is generated, you don't need to push it

2) .idea, never push this folder, it's generated by your IDE

3) .package, it'll be generated when you install dependencies, no need to push it

4) i_am_ruch.iml, IML is a module file created by IntelliJ IDEA, no need to push it

5) pubspec.lock is generated by pub, you don't need to push it
   If you're working on a application (not a library), you should definitely version control pubspec.lock.
   This way other developers will make sure they're using the same lib versions.

6) build folder is generated during the project's build

So finally, you must push the android, lib, ios, images, .gitignore, pubspec.yaml and README.md

ios, android folder contains native code and configuration for each platform
lib contains you flutter code
images, I guess it's resources
pubspec.yaml contains dependencies to install during pub get, and some project configuration
If you want the perfect flutter' gitignore: here it is (from official Flutter Github Repository)
